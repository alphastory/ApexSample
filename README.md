####Introduction

This is a chunk of code that manages the location finder on [Apex Energy Solutions](http://www.apexenergygroup.com). Once you've navigated to that page, you may click **Change Location** in the top right corner of the screen. You may enter a city, state or zip code in order to determine the franchise nearest you, within a 75 mile radius. Outside of the determined radius, we will present the user with a message to encourage Franchise opportunities.

Updating the location will cause the rest of the site to adjust to that market's specific information. For example, Denver will change the contact page and footer information to provide the user with specific information for that market. If the user is not within range of a market when they use geolocation, they will be assigned Indianapolis, IN (HQ) until they change it to something closer to home.
